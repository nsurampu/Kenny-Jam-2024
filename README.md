## Description
Once upon a time, on a planet far distant from ours, there lived 4 tribes in harmony. That changed when a neuro-parasite spread through the entire planet, turning everyone into drones that attacked the non-infected.

Following the initial devastation and the pause in the parasite spread due to reasons unknown, pockets of resistance have formed in a quest to eliminate the infected. The player fills the shoes of one such resistance member of the gray tribe, who is currently stranded, surrounded by a swarm of enemies.

Equipped with just one weapon the resistance calls the Verbindung Aura Burst (VAB), will you survive, or succumb to the swarm?

## Gameplay
The game is modelled as a semi-endless experience, with the main objective being achieving as high of a score as possible. You will use the VAB to eliminate the swarm by:

Connecting the enemies first. This creates a chain of enemies that can be eliminated with a single VAB burst
Longer chains, and reduced variety of enemies in the chain, both contribute to the bonus multiplier that is applied to the score on burst activation
Once you have a chain, activate the VAB burst t eliminate all connected enemies in one swoop
The swarm is near-endless, but surely, that can't be right, can it?

## Notes
This game was built as part of the Kenny 2024 Jam.
